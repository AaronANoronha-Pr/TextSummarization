            "By . Daily Mail Reporter . A giant coffee shop billboard featuring a naked woman is brewing controversy in Washington, with locals demanding the racy sign be pulled down. A picture of a blonde woman bearing her rear in a tiny g-string adorns the 10-foot-tall mobile billboard, parked on the side of various busy highways to promote two lingerie coffee bars. While the unidentified business owner insists she has a right to advertise her coffee stands as she chooses, some locals are disgusted at the graphic nudity. 'It's completely unacceptable and I am offended,' mother-of-four Susan Evans told KXLY.com, noting she once ate with her family across the street from the sign. 'This must be taken down.' Scroll down for video . Controversy brewing: Some locals are outraged at this billboard for 2nd Base Lingerie Espresso which features a nude woman with wings on a Washington state highway . It moves: The traveling billboard is shuttled between two Washington coffee stands - 2nd Base Lingerie Espresso in Spokane Valley and Big Shots Espresso in Spokane . The saucy sign is moved between 2nd Base Lingerie Espresso on East Sprague in Spokane Valley and Big Shots Espresso in Spokane city. The owner of both outlets, who refused to be identified, told KHQ.com that she is not concerned with the community's frustration, and is focused on running her business. The woman who appears on the billboard, identified by My Fox Orlando as Amanda Bennett, agrees. Bennett, a mother who works as a bikini barista at Big Shots Espresso, told Fox the sign shows nothing more than you'd see at the beach. 'At least I have a job,' she said. 'I could be a mom out on the side of a road begging for money like all the people downtown or living in a homeless shelter, but this takes care of my family.' Bikini barista: Amanda Bennett (pictured left and right), the woman who reportedly appears on the controversial billboard, works at Big Shots Espresso in Washington . Mother: Amanda Bennett, pictured with her partner and child, says that she believes the sign shows nothing more than people would see at the beach and she is trying to support her family . However, many locals don't share the bikini babe's point of view. 'It's not something I'd want my daughter to see if I brought her with me,' Kandace Holquist, an employee of a nearby restaurant, told NWCN.com. 'I thought it was funny for a minute, but the second after that it was kind of like - kids [will be] driving by and looking at stuff,' Miguel Hernandez, also a restaurant employee in the area, said. Resident Kevina Howe told Fox: 'I think women should have more self respect than that and they don’t and that just baffles me.' Joey Johnston, who works at a nearby burger shop, said he can see why families are angry. 'This is a family restaurant and this area, people drive by all the time,' Johnston told KXLY.com. 'Like I said, I don't have a problem with it, maybe if it was just a little less revealing.' Fox reported that code enforcers said the sign was not allowed in the city of Spokane, but did not give a reason, while authorities for the Valley have not commented.

Other option: This billboard for a second coffee shop, Big Shots Lingerie Espresso, features scantily-clad - but not nude - women . Spokane, North Idaho News .\n",

            "By . Rob Cooper . PUBLISHED: . 03:05 EST, 16 May 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 05:49 EST, 16 May 2012 . It's not often that the wine makers of Champagne are left feeling a little bit flat. But vineyards across the north of England are toasting extraordinary success - as climate change makes the region ideal for wine-making. Just over 25 years ago, Renishaw Hall, near Sheffield, was the most northern vineyard in the world. Toasting success: Kieron Atkinson, who runs the English Wine Project, at Renishaw Hall which is planning to double output to 6,000 bottles per year . Yet as they celebrate their 40th anniversary this year they are planning to double the number of white wines they produce from 3,000 to up to 6,000 per year. Vineyards across the north of England have seen demand soar as the quality of their grapes improves - and they are giving their more illustrious French rivals a run for their money in the sparkling wine stakes. As temperatures increase because of climate change, grapes become more acidic. But unlike in Champagne, northern France, it is not too hot in northern England. Improved trellis systems and management techniques have also helped British manufacturers close the gap on their continental rivals. Chateau Doncaster: The town in northern England has become the unlikely home of sparkling white wines rivaling those from Champagne . Even in Doncaster, South Yorkshire, vineyards have been able to produce wine with 12 per cent natural alcohol. The Summerhouse vineyard on the outskirts of the northern town started production in 2005 and has rapidly seen its output increase. But despite their growing success, their are still only a small number of northern vineyards spread across Yorkshire, Lancashire and Derbyshire. Across England, winemakers have seen demand soar in recent years - although until now it has largely been manufacturers in the south getting all the accolades. Last year, two English rosés, produced just a few miles from the M25 in Surrey and Kent, scooped top international awards at the wine world's 'Oscars', proving the nation does not need Mediterranean heat to turn out a top tipple. Toasting success: The head gardener works on the vines at Renishaw Hall, Derbyshire . Kent-based Chapel Down, the winemaker which provided white wine for Prince William's wedding to Kate Middleton, picked up a gold medal for its sparkling Vintage Rosé Brut at the International Wine Challenge, the world's biggest and most important wine competition. And just a few miles down the road, Denbies Chalk Ridge Rose 2010, produced on the hillsides of Dorking, Surrey, beat off stiff competition from more than 360 producers from 21 countries across the globe to win the still rosé gold medal prize. Kieron Atkinson, who runs the English Wine Project, told The Times that northern winemakers are giving Champagne a run for their money. 'We are cooler than Champagne, which means we have nicer levels of acid in our grapes. That makes for a better sparkling wine,' he said. 'We are still relatively young at doing this in comparison with the Champagne region but our techniques are catching up, hence our ability to get better and better wine every year.' He added: 'I guess the alarm bells for the Champagne region are ringing because the summers are so much hotter.' Running scared? A French vineyard which is facing unlikely competition from wine makers in the north of England .\n",

            "(CNN)The Anti-Defamation League has condemned a product sold in Urban Outfitters stores that it says resembles uniforms prisoners were forced to wear during the Holocaust. The gray and white striped tapestry features pink triangles. During the Holocaust, gay people were made to wear a pink triangle for identification purposes. A letter from the ADL to Urban Outfitters President and CEO Richard A. Hayne objected to the \"insensitive design and the company's periodic use of products within the realm of Holocaust imagery.\" A request for comment from Urban Outfitters was not immediately answered Tuesday. \"Whether intentional or not, this gray and white stripped pattern and pink triangle combination is deeply offensive and should not be mainstreamed into popular culture,\" said ADL National Director Abraham H. Foxman in the letter. The ADL took the retailer to task in 2012 for selling a T-shirt with a star on its pocket, claiming the design looked like the Star of David symbol that Jewish people were made to wear during the Holocaust. The product \"represents a new low,\" the ADL said at the time. Urban Outfitters has been criticized and even sued for selling other products, including designs labeled \"Navajo.\" The retailer stopped selling a \"vintage\" Kent State sweatshirt that had what appeared to be simulated blood splatter on it last year after objections flooded in. Kent State was the site of a 1970 shooting that left four students dead and nine wounded during a Vietnam War protest. Urban Outfitters issued an apology via Twitter and said the red stains were not meant to resemble blood.\n",

            "A bureau de change boss who recruited his wife and son to help clean up nearly £170 million-worth of criminal cash has been jailed for nine years. Ussama El-Kurd, 64, known as 'Sammy the Kurd' in underworld circles, was on bail pending an appeal for a previous money laundering conviction when he set up the business in 2006. He enlisted his wife Randa, 51, and son Husain, 22, to help run the Kensington Money Exchange in upmarket Notting Hill, west London. Ussama El-Kurd, known as 'Sammy the Kurd', was on bail for a previous money laundering conviction when he set up the business in 2006 . Their efforts allowed the proceeds of drug dealing, violent robberies and other major crimes to be spent freely by offenders. The Palestinian-born family ran their 'bespoke money laundering service' in Kensington Church Street. No records of the dodgy transactions were kept, but authorities say the business must have helped to wash at least £169m until it was shut down in 2010. They estimate just one-sixth of the trade carried out at the store was legitimate. Ussama El-Kurd wept as he was led away to the cells to begin a nine-year jail term after a judge told him he had caused 'harm on a truly major scale.' Mr Justice Irwin told him: 'That volume of money laundering represented the proceeds of no doubt drug dealing, no doubt extortion, no doubt robbery and violence and all the other aspects of major crime. Mother and son: Husain El-Kurd (left) and Randa El-Kurd (right) were convicted at Southwark Crown Court . 'You began this offending while on bail for an appeal and then facing a potential retrial for your previous offending. 'You defied the courts when you began this offence.' He was found guilty of a near-identical offence in 1999 and jailed for 14 years - though the conviction was later quashed on appeal. The new venture was set up following his release in April 2006. El-Kurd's wife Randa was jailed for ten months for turning a 'blind eye' to his deception while listed as a director of the firm. She claimed she had not attended court during the earlier trial and had tried to shield her family from publicity. But the court heard she was well-versed in the business world, having set up her own property firm in west London. Kensington Money Exchange where Sammy the Kurd recruited his wife and son to help money launder . The judge said he accepted she had played no part in the money laundering itself, but added: 'You turned a deliberate blind eye to what your husband was doing. 'He may have told you he was carrying on business legitimately but you didn't check.' Brunel University student Husain El-Kurd was recruited to work as a delivery driver and man the store while his parents were on holiday. He pleaded to be spared jail so he could continue his studies in international management. But he also received a ten-month jail term and was told he had played an 'active role' in the enterprise. He and his mother embraced in the dock as their sentences were read out. Ussama El-Kurd was banned from acting as a company director for ten years, his wife for five years and his son for three years. Annie Conway, specialist prosecutor for the CPS organised crime Division, said: 'Ussama El-Kurd was laundering criminals' money on a truly industrial scale. 'He made a considerable living cleaning dirty money and helping organised criminals go undetected. 'With the help of his wife and son, El Kurd ran what appeared to be an inconspicuous money exchange shop on Kensington Church Street. The shop was a magnet for criminals who changed up to £150million in Euros before spiriting it away . 'But the shop was a magnet for criminals who changed up to £150 million into Euros before spiriting it away. 'Today's sentencing stops not just these three criminals, but all those who relied on the El-Kurds to enjoy a criminal lifestyle.' Brendan Foreman, SOCA Regional Head of Investigations, said: 'This was no legitimate business venture, it was simply an enterprise designed to enable criminals to prosper while living lives of luxury in foreign jurisdictions both near and far. 'El Kurd has personally profited and the considerable assets he managed to accrue will now be pursued through the courts. 'This investigation will have had a significant impact on organised crime groups operating in the UK and overseas. 'Many have had their criminal proceeds seized whilst others have been denied access to a money laundering mechanism that operated under the guise of a legitimate business on a UK high street.' Usamma El-Kurd, of Lynwood Road, Ealing, west London, admitted conspiracy to conceal, disguise, convert, transfer or remove criminal property from the UK. His son, of the same address, admitted failing to disclose suspicious transactions. Randa El-Kurd admitted neglecting her role as a company director, contrary to the 2007 Money Laundering Regulations.\n",

            "It may be one of the most stylish uniforms in the skies, but Virgin Atlantic’s cabin crew have been getting a bit hot under the collar about their new look. The striking red outfits were designed by Vivienne Westwood and launched to much fanfare on September 1. But the airline's crew members have since complained that the uniforms are too tight and that the shoes give them blisters. Red alert: The new uniforms were handed out to over 7,500 Virgin Atlantic staff in September . The uniform features a double-breasted ‘drape coat’, which can be worn fastened or open . Staff also complained that the skirts are too high-waisted and don't fit properly, while the collars are so tight they make them bleed, according to union Unite. A Unite spokesperson told The Sun: ‘We’ve had members complaining of poor comfort and injury caused by the new uniform and mainly as a result of blistering from shoes and garment fit.’ But Virgin Atlantic said the initial feedback from staff had been 'fantastic' and that the uniform could be tailored to fit all shapes and sizes. A Virgin Atlantic spokesperson told MailOnline: 'Virgin Atlantic is extremely excited to launch its new uniform collection and initial feedback from staff has been fantastic . 'To ensure the uniform was fit for purpose across our network, we conducted wearer trials globally for six months with over 150 staff volunteers who provided daily feedback on the fabric, fit, practicality and wearability of the uniform. 'Adjustments were then made accordingly before the designs and fabrics were finalised. 'We recognise that the fit is different to the previous uniform and to ensure correct sizing, all staff tried on the uniform and were fitted by our expert team upon collection. We have uniforms available in sizes from 6 to 30 and garments can be tailored to fit all shapes and sizes.' Fanfare: Virgin Atlantic's boss Sir Richard Branson hosted a launch party for the new uniforms in July . VIP guests: Singer Debbie Harry and Vivienne Westwood joined Sir Richard Branson at the launch party . Sir Richard Branson’s airline launched the new uniforms at a star-studded party in July. Among the guests at the event in London were former Doctor Who star Matt Smith, Bond girl Naomi Harris, singer Debbie Harry and Vivienne Westwood herself. The uniforms were made using recycled polyester clothing and took inspiration from some of Westwood’s most iconic pieces. Female cabin crew wear a red pencil skirt, with a double pleat at the back, and a dramatic asymmetric frill-front blouse. The look is completed by a red jacket with a nipped in waist and high collar that was inspired by Westwood’s early 90s 'Bettina' jacket. There is also a double-breasted ‘drape coat’ with an oversized collar, which can be worn fastened or open. The red shoe worn by female crew is available in three heights. A Virgin Atlantic spokesperson said: 'We understand the importance of comfortable footwear therefore the shoes were trialled extensively on the ground and in the air. 'We offer a choice of low, medium and high heels for the women and based on feedback, looking to bring in a wider-fitting shoe. However, with all leather footwear, it will take time for them to wear in and be comfortable.' The hand-drawn wing designs are a recurring theme across all members of the team and male crew members wear a Savile Row-inspired three piece suit in a deep burgundy Oxford weave wool. Going green: The stylish new uniforms were made using recycled polyester clothing . Male crew members wear a Savile Row-inspired three piece suit in a deep burgundy Oxford weave wool . Over 7,500 staff including cabin crew, pilots, Clubhouse staff and Virgin Holidays employees received the new uniform consisting of 22 pieces in total. On a blog on its website, Virgin Atlantic said the uniforms were 'comfortable and practical' and had undergone a trial before their introduction on September 1. It also stated that staff provided feedback after each flight or shift so that adjustments could be made ahead of the full launch. The uniform was assessed on 'fit, comfort, breathability, ease of movement, creasing before and after the shift, look and feel of the uniform after laundering and how the uniform handles marks and stains'. Virgin Atlantic said: 'We take all feedback very seriously and are working really hard with our uniform wearers to offer a uniform they feel proud to wear and to ensure they are happy and comfortable in their working environment.'\n",

            "By . Associated Press Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 04:51 EST, 3 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 05:00 EST, 3 May 2013 . A dying, paralyzed shooting victim who couldn't speak, intentionally blinked his eyes to identify a photo of his attacker for authorities, prosecutors have said in the opening statements of the suspect's murder trial. Defese lawyers in the trial of alleged killer Ricardo Woods say blinking cannot be considered consistent, reliable evidence. Over the next few weeks, jurors will be asked to decide whether Woods killed David Chandler, of Cincinnati. Incident: David Chandler, left, identified, 34-year-old Ricardo Woods (right), who has now been charged with murder, felonious assault and weapons counts and faces up to life in prison if convicted . Paralyzed and hooked up to a . ventilator, David Chandler was two weeks from death when police arrived . at his hospital room to question him about the person who shot him. They . wanted to know if he could identify a suspect, and they had a photo to . show him. Chandler was unable to communicate . except with his eyes as he lay in bed attached to myriad tubes and with a . brace around his neck. His eyes opened barely more than a slit at . times; he was instructed to blink three times for yes and twice for no. One detective quizzed him, and another videotaped his responses. Chandler . didn't respond with blinks to every question in the 17-minute video, . and there were solo blinks. But triple blinks came in response to . repeated questions asking if he knew the shooter and whether the person . in the photo was the culprit. Legal experts say such cases - while not unheard of - are unusual, and dying identifications relying on gestures rather than words are often not used in trials because of concern over reliability or differing interpretations. But some have been used in murder cases around the country that have ended in convictions. Suspect: Ricardo Woods is led out of the courtroom last year after the murder trial was postponed . Police . asked Chandler to blink three times for yes and twice for no to a . series of questions in the interview, said Assistant Hamilton County . Prosecutor David Prem. Chandler also blinked yes to indicate . that he knew the gunman and that his name began with the letter O, Prem . said. O was a street name that Woods sometimes used, the prosecutor . said. Prem told jurors that when they view the video, they will clearly see that Chandler knew what he was doing. 'You are going to see how he was struggling to get it right,' Prem said. The motive for the shooting, the prosecutor said, was that Chandler owed Woods money for drugs. Chandler was a drug user who had . bought drugs many times from Woods but had gone to an area near Woods' home the night of the shooting with two friends to buy drugs from . someone else. Chandler was shot about 20 yards from Woods' home and in an area known for drug deals, he said. Familiar: Woods reportedly knew the victim through drug deals . Prem said that while neither of the . men in the car with Chandler could clearly identify the man who shot . him, one heard a voice yelling Chandler's name. Defense attorney Wendy Calaway . insisted that Woods did not shoot Chandler and is 'an innocent man who . found himself in a perfect storm of misinformation and . misidentification'. Calaway said Chandler had stolen drugs from dealers . previously. 'He had many enemies,' Calaway said of Chandler. He had received threats and was . considered a 'snitch' who informed on drug dealers to police, according . to Calaway. Police decided before their investigation was completed that . Woods was the shooter and never followed up on any other leads, Calaway . said. Calaway also focused on the blinking . identification, saying that while doctors were able to establish a 'rudimentary' communication system with Chandler, 'his blinks were . inconsistent and sporadic'. Law: Judge Beth Myers of Hamilton County Common Pleas Court ruled at an earlier hearing that jurors could see the videotape, saying she found the blinks reliable . He only blinked in response to doctors' commands about 50 percent of the time, she said. Both sides are expected to call . medical experts to testify about the ability of someone in Woods' condition to understand and respond to questions. Other witnesses expected to be called . include a priest who was a friend to Chandler and gave him money before . the shooting, Prem said. A man who was in jail with Woods will testify . that Woods told him that he didn't mean to kill Chandler but that he was . angry that Chandler owed him money for drugs and was trying to buy . drugs from someone else, Prem said. The judge has said that the trial could take up to three weeks. Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.\n",

            "(CNN) -- A day after Miriam Carey ran a barricade and led police on a high-velocity chase through the middle of the nation's capital, authorities were searching for clues to explain the bizarre chain of events that led to her death. Although Carey was shot while driving with her baby, the child was uninjured. Many questions surrounding those facts remain. Related: Was the shooting justified? Here's what we know about Carey, a 34-year-old who reportedly had worked as a dental hygienist in Connecticut. Boyfriend: She thought the president was monitoring her . A law enforcement source involved in the investigation said Thursday that Carey's boyfriend had told police last winter that she appeared to be delusional. The boyfriend said she claimed President Barack Obama had placed Stamford, Connecticut, where she lived, under lockdown and that her house was under electronic surveillance, the source said. He told police that she was suffering from postpartum depression, was having trouble sleeping and was on medication. Carey underwent a mental health evaluation, the source said. Related: What is postpartum psychosis? Authorities have not officially linked the incident to mental illness or any other factor. Postpartum psychosis . A few months after her daughter was born, Miriam Carey was diagnosed with postpartum depression with psychosis, her sister told CNN's AC360. Postpartum psychosis can cause delusions and paranoia, according to medical experts. \"There wasn't a pattern. It was something that occurred suddenly,\" Amy Carey-Jones said. \"She seemed overwhelmed. There was a lot of stress. \"There was not moments of her walking around with delusions. That was not what was going on.\" But her sister was making progress with the help of counseling and medications. Carey-Jones said her sister recently told her that the doctors told her she didn't need the medication anymore. \"They tapered her off the medications, and she said she felt fine,\" Carey-Jones said. She declined to discuss what medication Miriam Carey had taken. Her home . Carey lived in an apartment that authorities searched Friday. Medication . During the search, authorities found discharge papers from a 2012 mental health evaluation that listed prescriptions for medications to treat depression, schizophrenia and bipolar disorder -- a law enforcement source briefed on the investigation said Friday. Earlier, sources said investigators found medications, but that proved later not to be accurate. Authorities found a laptop computer, a flash drive and three non-working cell phones, the source said. A letter . The source told CNN that Carey left a letter addressed to the boyfriend at her apartment and that it appeared to contain white powder. The letter was being tested for hazardous substances. The baby girl . After surviving a high-speed police chase with Carey at the wheel, authorities placed the girl with a foster family, a spokesperson for Washington's Child and Family Services Agency told CNN. During the chase, no shots were fired from the Infinity, CNN's Deborah Feyerick reported. All shots were from law enforcement directed at the passenger side of the car. New York relatives . In Brooklyn in New York City, where Carey's mother and one of her four sisters live, a neighbor reported seeing the suspect Tuesday picking up her daughter. When federal agents arrived to conduct questioning, no one at the apartment answered the door. Carey's Facebook page includes a map pinpointing Stamford and New York. CNN's Chelsea J. Carter, Carol Cratty, Deborah Feyerick, and Joe Johns contributed to this report.\n",
